(I ask, with an over 40-page, 16,000-word mostly-backstory document sitting on my laptop and it's not even done)  (I don't know how this happened, I swear)
Auris' concept was originally meant to be a bard; someone over-the-top who boasts about ridiculous accomplishments of which one or two are provably true and make you almost wonder if there's some truth to the rest of them.  She turned into something else entirely--but that core concept of having some incredible, ridiculous introduction stuck around.  She has earned throughout her life a number of names for herself, and in her full introduction lists and explains each of them (and, unlike the original concept, all the stories are, in fact, true).  Said introduction continues to grow as she does more things and, at the last time I timed it, clocks in at just over 7 minutes long.
She is a paladin of a homebrewed god of honor, warlock to a slightly different facet of the same god, and her sorcerer powers showed up when she was studying the warlock versus paladin magic and found an entirely new way to do things (and there's honestly probably a decent connection to the same god through those as well).

Their children have a few slight features of the parent’s patron, and generally they make a pact with the same patron. Their children have even more features of the patron, and it keeps repeating like so. For getting racial stats for a Tiefling, at least for an earlier-generation Tiefling, you take the racial bonuses of whatever race the character is partially, and take only some of the racial abilities of a Tiefling.

My character Ikala (AFAB agender, they/them) is a third generation Tiefling, and their mother was in a pact with a homebrew version of Graz’zt. She tried to get away from Graz’zt, and she took her husband and child and ran away when Ikala was 12. Graz’zt found them and killed Ikala’s parents, and left Ikala alive. For years he kept trying to make a pact with Ikala, even trying to trick them into one, to no avail, until session 2 of the campaign. Ikala died to an ogre’s club, and Graz’zt came to them in death. He made an offer where he’d revive them, if they became a warlock and did his bidding. Ikala is now a druid/unwilling-warlock. 

They always had a strong fear of death, which is even stronger now that they’ve died once. They’re also absolutely terrified of Graz’zt, and will do anything to keep him happy for fear of him killing them like he did their parents, even if that means sabotaging the party’s quest (it hasn’t come up yet, but if it does, that’s what Ikala will do). Ikala’s always been apathetic to concepts of gender, sex, and romance, but did like the idea of having children until Graz’zt’s pact came along. They’re now rethinking whether or not they want children some day, to protect those hypothetical children from Graz’zt. 

A short, funny story: my favourite line of Ikala’s is “I DIED, TOUCH THE FROG”. Earlier in the session where Ikala died, the party had captured a poisonous frog and had it in a cage in Ikala’s bag. After the ogre fight, the party checked the bag to make sure the frog was still alive. It was, but it was now loose in their bag. One party member is a Chitine, and didn’t think (but wasn’t sure) if it’d hurt him or not. The two got into a heated debate as to how to deal with the frog, which led to Ikala shouting “I DIED, TOUCH THE FROG”. Ikala later started to feel a “kid brother” connection with him, even though he’s older than them.",azurediamond51@gmail.com,hermit

She was already training in the monk tradition for Melora, but there was always some part of her that felt she needed more than what Melora could offer.

One night after being tasked to kill the family of one of the local law enforcement that was hunting their cult down, he had a change of heart after seeing the damage and the pain he had caused the surviving children. He then ran away from the life of cultism and had been on the run ever since. 

One fateful day, he was cornered in an Alleyway by an elf who introduced himself as Von Jhiro, along with a yuan-ti named Artix. They introduced themselves as a small religious order (it was just another cult really), following the path and guidance of a minor deity known as Pandora. 

Pandora was a human who, much like her story's namesake, had unleashed evil to the world. Rather than run away and fend for her life however, she sought to rectify her mistake, and embark on a journey to imprison these entities back into the box from which they were imprisoned. The journey was long and arduous, taking up most of her entire life. And when she was done, quest completed, she was bestowed divinity. She was from then on known as the Lady of Redemption. But her identity has since then been forgotten until now.

Now Jaune, along with the rest of the Order of the Lotus Phoenix, are on a religious journey to spread the name and deeds of Pandora throughout all the lands.",darricoliveros112@gmail.com,custom

Even if they won’t respect her power, she’ll simply take control by force and kill any who resist. Knowledge is the path to power and domination. Unlocking an ancient mystery is worth the price of a civilisation to her.  Soon after leaving the Goliaths she joined a military encampment she came across. There she studied and fought and killed. She lost her eye in one fight and now wears an eye patch. Her mentor guided her in ice magic. Now she travels from place to place with her crow familiar Bliz, who she bickers with constantly, and her nose in a book. While she can be hard and cold, she is still young and loves smaller acts of ‘evil’ and trickery, which she views as affection, shes loves pranking companions and insulting them. She works well enough in a team, and will help others achieve their goals as long as they don’t get in the way of her. She wants to build their loyalty towards her. She hides her eviler and more torturous/murderous tendencies as best she can. Though in battle a perceptive teammate would probably notice  she kills foes far more slowly and painfully then is needed. She is also far to keen to torture and interrogate for information, but will brush it off as ‘just doing her part to help the team get the information they need’. Perhaps there is some hope for her to be good one day. Because, although she seeks power from magic, that genuine enjoyment of learning that she had since a child is still there.

As I was growing up I would have what I thought were dreams. The dreams were of people and places I had never been nor seen. Three people did look more familiar. One was a woman with long white hair wearing a long silver-white dress that shines carrying a staff and wearing a crown the other two were a female and male drow. The man had silver shoulder length hair up in a bun and wearing robes with silver trimming carrying a book. The woman had silver short messy hair and was wearing a breastplate carrying a sword and shield.They both had crystal blue eyes. They had dark blue-gray skin. I have told no one about the dreams.  I was also more comfortable being called Grim but I was never sure why. Only my family and close friend called me Grim. As I grew older I got used to being called Logan.For some reason I have the urge to head to Xhorhas.
My family lives in Rexxentrum at the family estate.
I live in Zadash in a studio apartment for the time for my studies (I have only lived there for about a month).                    (size of) 

Family
Father-Lord or General Lucas Darkland age-48 6’0 210lb gray eyes, short brown hair (Alive) (lvl you decide i’ll make if you want) (Class:Fighter Battle master).
My father is a stern but loving man. He was tough when it came to swordsmanship lessons.My father is a Noble General in the Empire. He would rather fight and lead on the front lines then sit in a tent and plan. He is known as one of the strongest martial General’s. (He uses a sword shield spear and a greataxe. His preferences.)

Mother-Lady Isobel Darkland age-46 5’7 95lb blue eyes long reddish brown hair that she wears in a ponytail (Alive) Civi
 My mother is a kind hearted woman. Quiet but speaks her mind when needed.She loves me and my sister very much. From time to time she would  anonamysly help duy some food for the less fortunate people and give it to the temples to serve. She is one of those people that people can't help but want to be around. 

Sister-Stella Darkland age-18 5’8 105lb blueish-gray eyes short reddish brown messy hair (Alive) (lvl you decide i'll make if you want) Class:Fighter Eldritch Knight
My sister is a tom-boy she loves to play and ruffhouse.We get along very well.She loves combat training with father.When she started to take interest and excelled dad let up on me a little. She would also love sneaking into my workshop and bug me to let her help. So I started to teach her some spells she could use in combat. She is an outgoing athletic type of person she loves to pull pranks but can get serious when the time arises. (She uses a sword and shield.) 



Allys
Narcesra Kryn female Drow age-??? Ht5’9 100lb
(Ally chart 81-90 for Narcesra) 
Narisdal Kryn male Drow age-??? Ht5’9 95lb
Narcesra and Narisdal are siblings. I don’t remember this yet (In my past life we were close friends and in the same den.I was a battlefield tactician.)
(I’ll let you decide how I died.) I died in the empire near a lost becon and was reborn as Logan “Grim” Darkland.

Ally/Rival
Lady Vess DeRogna- She was my teacher at the Soltryce Academy for the time I was attending. We shared a kindred fascination for antiquities and magic items. We have a love/hate relationship. We get along and work great together and would do anything for one another but we can get very irritated with one another and not speak with one another for weeks at a time. 

Rival
Brun Heartshield Half-Elf age-26 5’9 125lb blueish green eyes spiky blond hair Class:Bard/College of Valor
(Rival chart 51-60) Brun is someone I still consider a friend. We met when we were young. I was sneaking away from my parents at the city market and bumped into him. We became fast friends. He is the sun of a traveling merchant so he would be in town every other month.We would hang out and play. I would teach him swordsmanship, undercommon and try to teach some magic he could not wrap his head around some of it. But one day he started to notice the differences in my behavior.  

Palma Flora
I was in Palma Flora looking for an artifact or magic item that was rumored to have sunk with a ship nearby some time ago. Vess had told me about it but she had another lead to follow.So I decided to go. I was watching the shark hunt to recruit the hunters on my journey and to get some water breathing potions. I travel under the alias of Logan Grim during war time and so no one will notice me.

It’s a homebrew race and the background is that he is an “Emissary” of the church, basically a covert enforcer who collects tithings and collects heretics and murmurers for “re-education”. He doesn’t know what the church is doing is evil, he was raised with the mentality to always trust the church, and he blindly follows them.

A Moonfolk from rustic origins in the farming community of Faegrass, she has felt another voice speaking to her in her nightmares since she was young and as she has gotten older, the voice speaks to her in waking too.  She was diagnosed with fell whispers (schizophrenia) and couldn't make it on her family's landscaping and development business.

A shame and burden to her family, she left and fell on hard times, only to find work selling herself as a coin lass in Baldur's Gate.  This was her lowest point, until she had a client who was a designer who, in a last minute crisis, needed a hand the night before a piece for a client needed to be finalized.  In his desperation, he noted her height and build, hiring her off the street to model the piece and assist with the overnight crunch.  

At dawn, she stood on his stoop, unable to leave.  She had felt her humanity return, in a sea of exploitation, hateful voices and emptiness, and she didn't want to feel it leave again.  She cried openly and the man, Olivier L'Marque, came to shoo her off, but couldn't bring himself to do so.  He brought her in for tea, heard her story, and said he would try to find her work.

In the years that followed she found work modeling for and assisting designer after designer who would employ her.  Some she disappointed, eventually she found one she didn't, the designer and practitioner of Sune, the Aarakocra Señora Isla Santiago.  The colorful, middle aged avian took a shine to her and Saffron came to believe in many of her ideas (beauty is a life force that transcends magic).  She found her own voice and a beauty to express. She owes such a debt to so many in her Guild, she seeks to bring out that individual beauty in the world and to pay her debts forward.

When she uses magic or sorcery points, she begins to look more like the vague image of the Voice (what she calls him, or the Nightmare Man as a child), including a single spiraled horn pointing up from her left temple and progressively greater changes as she uses the magic.

The Nightmare Man, under the guise of a client, lured her out of the city on a trip.  Goading her power, the Nightmare Man revealed the facade en route to their destination.  Terrified, she fled calling for help, which the Valiant Tortle Monk Hitoshi answered. The Nightmare Man’s machinations were eventually revealed and along with Hitoshi’s fellow adventurer, the Wizened Vedalken Dreamsage Athozad, the group engaged the Nightmare Man’s forces in Cormyr, emerging victorious after a hard fought battle. Determined to take back control of her life, she entered arcane tutelage under Athozad. She now regularly joins her veteran adventurer friends,  despite her amateur talents. She continues to push her limits and hopes to someday defeat the Nightmare Man forever. ",,guild member

Since then, she has quit the army and joined an anti-government communist group called the Redistributers. She's named after the Greek Nereid (she's a water genasi) and mother of Achilles.

Age: Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as Humans, the elven understanding of Adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims Adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

Alignment: Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.

Size: Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim Conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in Darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in Darkness, only Shades of Gray.

Keen Senses: You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

Fey Ancestry: You have advantage on Saving Throws against being Charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

Trance: Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After Resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.

High Elf
As a High Elf, you have a Keen Mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more Common and more friendly, and often encountered among Humans and other races.

Ability Score Increase: Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

Elf Weapon Training: You have proficiency with the Longsword, Shortsword, Shortbow, and Longbow.

Cantrip: You know one cantrip of your choice from the Wizard spell list. Intelligence is your Spellcasting Ability for it.

Extra Language: You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.(Sylvan)

Feature: Position of Privilege
Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.

So, my character is Female High Elf Warlock named Vivian Von Versailles, clad in emerald colored lolita fashion. Now, for a bit of context, Vivian has a devious, chaotic personality. She often uses her cutesy appearance and demeanor to her advantage whether it's for information gathering, getting what she wants, or even in combat by acting innocent and helpless (so most individuals will usually put their guards down around her). However, this is merely a ruse as she has a terrifying and ominous fey presence behind her immense power (her patron). When pressured, she has been known to show a sternly serious attitude towards her adversaries and allies alike. She is prone to violent outbursts whenever she is left out of a conversation or reminded of her true age (80 years old). (Especially as her father points out that in the next 20 years she will need to forgo the facade of acting as a child and take on an adult name). Vivian often perceives every word addressed to her as a veiled insult or threat and is fairly easy to anger. In her spare time she has gained something of a hobby collecting rare jewels during her travels.
​

The attitude of Vivian's family members toward has become somewhat concerned as of late considering that she offended a well-regarded member of a political house retaliation for an ""off the cuff"" comment directed at her demeanor. As punishment for her outburst, her father demanded a more proactive role in public affairs, away from the hostile parties and enemies of the Versailles family so as to prevent further damage socially. Hurt by this seeming betrayal by her father, she begrudgingly set out to make a name for herself among-st the people as an adventurer and public figure.",supergamesniper009@gmail.com,noble
